# Fake-News-Classifier
In this project, we are building fake news classifier using machine learning algorithms.

# Introduction
This project is used to build Fake News Classifier Using Natural Language Processing Model.

# Project Flow

1) Load the data into dataframe.

2) Perform data preprocessing like handling missing values, feature creation, etc.

3) Perform exploratory data analysis and get valuable insights from the data.

4) Perform feature selection and select best model which fits the data.
